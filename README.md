## Overview

> This project demonstrates a multi-service application leveraging Docker Compose. It features an Angular frontend for user interaction, a Spring Boot backend for API services, a Python monitoring service that uses selenoid for data collection, and a YOLO model service for vehicle detection in the obtained images.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Angular 19.2.6
- **Backend:** Spring Boot 3.4.4, Java 17
- **Image collection:** Python 3.13.3
- **AI/ML:** YOLO v11 (Ultralytics), Python 3.13.3
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Operating System (Developed/Tested On):** Debian 12 (Bookworm), Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) Server

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to install Docker (and Docker Compose) on your machine.

- **Docker Engine:** [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- **Optional (for development):**
    - Node.js v18.19.0 and npm 9.2.0 (for Angular development) [Link to Node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    - Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
    - Python and pip (for YOLO and monitoring services).

All python development was made using conda 25.1.1

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow the steps below.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    With https:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Idkode/sbcup-2025.git
    cd sbcup-2025
    ```

    With ssh:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Idkode/sbcup-2025.git
    cd sbcup-2025
    ```

### Configuration

All steps below presume that your user has permission to use docker commands without sudo (for Linux).

### Running the Application

Run the services using docker compose. Old docker installations might use a different command (docker-compose)

1.  **Build and start the services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```
    This command might take a while to run, since all images and dependencies will be installed. Also beware that some images, especially the python ones, take a lot of memory space due to the amount of dependencies. 

2.  **Accessing the applications:**
    - **Angular Frontend:** Typically accessible at `http://localhost:81`
    - **Spring Boot Backend:** Typically accessible at `http://localhost:8081/api` (externally from docker network)
    - **Selenium Service:** The selenium module is exclusively used by the monitoring service. Selenoid-UI can be accessed from `http://localhost:8080` to check the selenoid sessions. Selenoid-UI is an optional service.
    - **YOLO Model Service:** This service has only one endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/detect`. Backend sends requests to this endpoint to get the images' detections.

3.  **Stopping the services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose stop
    ```

    Or if you want to remove the containers:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```


## Service Details

Now, here is a brief explanation about each of the services.

### Angular Frontend

- This is the interface between the user and the cameras monitoring.
- As of now, only a dashboard page and a simple settings page are available.
- Depends on backend, model and monitoring services.
- Needs images collected from at least one camera to actually work.

### Spring Boot Backend

- Responsible for saving the images from the monitoring service, sending images to the model to get Detections and supplying data to frontend.
- Uses Spring Boot. Interacts with mongo database to save the images' data and detections.
- As of now, only Image endpoints are available. They can be checked at the ImageController class.

### Monitoring Service

- Configuration files are config.json and cameras.json.
- For monitoring purposes, jobType needs to be parallel.
- With the current configurations, the limit of cameras is 5. To increase the number, the limit would need to be altered in the selenoid service.
- Before running, it is recommended to check if the camera links are still valid, since most of them are changed periodically

### Selenoid Service

- Manages selenium sessions created by the monitoring service.
- Has a limit of 5 concurrent sessions, but can be altered through compose configurations.
- Beware that increasing the limit might increase CPU and memory usage
- Uses a custom firefox image to ensure correct images collection in some websites.

### YOLO Model Service

- Runs a YOLO model to process images and return detections. Since GPU configuration differs for each machine, it uses CPU for inference as of now.
